# Modelado-de-movimiento

It was created a system capable of tracking the leg position by the use of IMU's. the purpose of this project is to make a simple way to track the movement of the human body to make a posterior analysis.

The system gets the IMU information through the Bluetooth connection of an ESP32. The raw data is processed in a C# script and the data is displayed on a Unity scene.
